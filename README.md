# SwiftArc

**SwiftArc: Modular SwiftUI architecture for scalable iOS apps.**

SwiftArc is a modern, production-ready architecture for SwiftUI applications, empowering iOS developers to build scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich apps. By combining coordinators, app states, dependency injection, modular features, and the builder pattern, SwiftArc provides a structured yet flexible framework for real-world projects—from task managers to e-commerce apps.

---

## Key Features
- **Modular Features**: Compose reusable components like search bars, task lists, or product grids.
- **State Management**: Robust app states (e.g., `loggedIn`, `sessionExpired`) with persistence.
- **Dependency Injection**: Automated DI via a centralized `Dependencies` system.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Manage navigation flows with a hierarchical coordinator design.
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct apps and features declaratively for clarity and customization.
- **Production-Ready**: Handles edge cases like network failures, session expiration, and state restoration.

## Why SwiftArc?
SwiftArc is built for iOS developers who need a reliable architecture that scales with complexity. It shines in:
- **Real-World Apps**: Structure apps like task trackers, shopping platforms, or social tools.
- **Rapid Development**: Reuse features across views to accelerate prototyping.
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear separation of concerns for multi-developer projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- iOS 16 or later (SwiftUI-based)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/SwiftArc.git
   ```
2. Open `SwiftArc.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app to explore the default setup.

### Quick Start
SwiftArc revolves around its `AppBuilder`. Here’s a basic setup:
```swift
import SwiftArc

let app = AppBuilder()
    .withFeature(SearchBarFeature())
    .withFeature(UsersListFeature())
    .withFeature(SettingsPanelFeature())
    .build()
```

For real-world examples (e.g., a task management app), see the [Examples](#examples) section below.

## Architecture Overview
- **`AppBuilder`**: Constructs the app with customizable features and coordinators.
- **`RootCoordinator`**: Orchestrates navigation and app state transitions.
- **`AppFeature` Protocol**: Defines reusable UI and logic units (e.g., `SearchBarFeature`).
- **`ApplicationStateManager`**: Manages states like `loggedIn` or `sessionExpired`.
- **`DependencyContainer`**: Central hub for dependency injection.

### Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Break apps into features for reuse across views.
- **Flow Control**: Coordinators handle navigation, guided by app states.
- **Testability**: DI and isolated components make unit testing straightforward.

## Examples
SwiftArc is designed for tangible, production-grade apps. Below are placeholders for real-world examples (coming soon):
- **Task Manager**: Features a task list, search bar, and user settings with login/logout flows.
- **E-Commerce Dashboard**: Includes product grids, filters, and cart management.
- **Social Feed**: Combines a post list, profile panel, and search functionality.
