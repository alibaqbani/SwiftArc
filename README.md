# SwiftArc

**SwiftArc: Modular SwiftUI architecture for scalable iOS apps.**

SwiftArc is a modern, production-ready architecture for SwiftUI applications, empowering iOS developers to build scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich apps. By combining coordinators, app states, dependency injection, modular features, and the builder pattern, SwiftArc provides a structured yet flexible framework for real-world projectsâ€”from task managers to e-commerce apps.

## Key Features
- **Modular Features**: Compose reusable components like search bars, task lists, or product grids.
- **State Management**: Robust app states (e.g., `loggedIn`, `sessionExpired`) with persistence.
- **Dependency Injection**: Automated DI via a centralized `Dependencies` system.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Manage navigation flows with a hierarchical coordinator design.
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct apps and features declaratively for clarity and customization.
- **Production-Ready**: Handles edge cases like network failures, session expiration, and state restoration.

## Why SwiftArc?
SwiftArc is built for iOS developers who need a reliable architecture that scales with complexity. It shines in:
- **Real-World Apps**: Structure apps like task trackers, shopping platforms, or social tools.
- **Rapid Development**: Reuse features across views to accelerate prototyping.
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear separation of concerns for multi-developer projects.
